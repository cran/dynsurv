	* Changed the dependence on boost to package BH.

2014-04-10 Jun Yan <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Fixed compiling error from clang in thg constructor LogDenPar:
	changed this->N to static_cast<int> (this->N_).

	* Fixed warnings from clang in arm.c by commenting out the
	display function. Added random number state control to u_random.



2014-03-04 Jun Yan <jun.yan@uconn.edu>
	* Fixed the problem that splineCox did not work with a single
	covariate by adding drop=FALSE in splineCox:
	    DF <- cbind(id=1:N, mf[, 1][, 1:2], mf[, -1, drop=FALSE])

	* changed depends to import in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE.
	However, package survival is kept under "Depends"; otherwise,
	function Surv was not found in model.matrix. This may need
	to be fixed later.

	* modified example codes to use mydata and myformula instead of
	data and formula.

2012-03-14  Jun Yan  <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Removed tiCox.h and tiCox.cpp. Functions there are covered
	by bayesCox.

	* Cleaned the style of the code under src with astyle -s2.

2012-03-10  Jun Yan  <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Added system dependence on the boost library, which allows
	removal of the boost headers files from the src directory.
	The configure.ac file was adapted from that in package
	RQuantLib; thank Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.

	* Removed std:cout lines (Xiaojing Wang).

	* Replaced exit with return whenever possible. May need
	more fix later.
