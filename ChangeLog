	* Removed tiCox.h and tiCox.cpp. Functions there are covered
	by bayesCox.

	* Cleaned the style of the code under src with astyle -s2.

	* Added system dependence on the boost library, which allows
	removal of the boost headers files from the src directory.
	The configure.ac file was adapted from that in package
	RQuantLib; thank Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.

	* Removed std:cout lines (Xiaojing Wang).

	* Replaced exit with return whenever possible. May need
	more fix later.
