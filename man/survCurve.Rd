\title{Estimated Survival Function or Cumulative Hazard Function}
\usage{
survCurve(object, newdata, type = c("survival", "cumhaz"),
          level = 0.95, centered = FALSE, cache = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object returned by function \code{bayesCox}.}

\item{newdata}{An optional data frame used to generate a design matrix.}

\item{type}{An optional character value indicating the type of function to
compute. The possible values are "survival" and "cumhaz". The former
means the estimated survival function; the latter represents the
estimated cumulative hazard function for the given \code{newdata}.}

\item{level}{A numerical value between 0 and 1 indicating the level of
cradible band.}

\item{centered}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, the mean function for the
given \code{newdata} will be computed. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cache}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, the cache RData file will be
generated in the working directory to improve the performance of
function \code{survCurve} and \code{survDiff}. This option would be
quite helpful if the number of MCMC sample is large.}

\item{...}{Other arguments for further usage.}
}
\value{
A data frame with column: "Low", "Mid", "High", "Time", "Design",
and "type", and attribute, "surv" valued as "survCurve".
}
\description{
\code{survCurve} returns estimated suvival function or cumulative function
from posterior sample. Note that the function is currently only
applicable to the Bayesian dynamic Cox model with dynamic hazard, where the
control argument is specified to be \code{control = list(intercept = TRUE)}
in function \code{bayesCox}.
}
\details{
The estimated survival curve is a step function representing the posterior
mean survival proportion at the given time grid from the posterior sample.
The credible interval for the survival curve is constructed based on the
quantiles of all the survival curves from posterior sample at given credible
level.
